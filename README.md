**Overview**

This analysis looks at Citi bike usage data for New York City during August 2019. The analysis uses a combination of Python and Tableau to analyze and format the data, while Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard.

*Subscribers to the Citi bike program represented a larger share of usage when comparing weekday trends
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday had higher usage during the evening hours, while Saturday had more consistent usage throughout the day compared to other days of the week

**Summary**

This analysis revealed that bike usage was heavier during weekday morning and evening hours and throughout the day on Saturday. This trend could suggest that bike usage is used more by traditional 9am-5pm workers and more leisurely on weekdays. Additional data, such as a survey to determine intended use by day, is needed to support this claim, however. 

The data also revealed that starting and ending points were heaviest on the western portion of Manhattan. This seems to indicate that users who live in this area are also returning bikes to the same location at the end of their journey. Additional origin destination data may be useful to determine the exact locations of trips from these areas. This could also help Citi identify if additional locations are needed throughout the city to support movement. 

Males were also more likely to use bikes compared to other gender types. Additional survey data to dive deeper into reasoning for this could help determine if safety perhaps plays a factor.
